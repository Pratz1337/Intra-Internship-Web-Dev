# Intra-Internship-Web-Dev
An internship (skill lab) organised by M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology for the skill development of freshers. This is done after the Semester End Examination of 2nd Semester.
Out of the multiple available courses to choose from I chose Hybrid Web Development.
The Reason for choosing this course is-
    1. Its easy af.
    2. I already know Web Dev so I am just wanted to speedrun this Internship.
The internship is of 1 week where we have to submit multiple assignments by the end of the Internship.
Unlike the paid internships where you are paid for working, here you have to pay 30k which is mandatory.(For legal reasons, that's a joke)
I hope you can refer to my repo and that it might help you in your internship journey.
NOTE- I am not responsible for any misuse in any sorts of way of this repository , my only intent is to share this with everyone for reference purpose only.
Thank You for your time :)
